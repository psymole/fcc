          <li><strong>1959</strong>, At only 17 years old, Hawking begins studying physics at Oxford University. Finding the work quite easy, Hawking studies very little. During his last year of study, Hawking becomes increasingly clumsy.</li>
          <li><strong>1962</strong>, After receiving a first-class honors degree in natural science from Oxford, Hawking starts his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.</li>
          <li><strong>1963</strong>, Just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking is diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – a rare disease that affects movement and speech. He is told he is only likely to live for two more years.</li>

          <li><strong>1965</strong>, Hawking writes his thesis based on applying Roger Penrose's theory of space-time singularity.</li>
          <li><strong>1966</strong>, Hawking completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius Collage, Cambridge.</li>
          <li><strong>1966</strong>, Hawking's essay Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time wins him the Adams Prize.</li>
          <li><strong>1968</strong>, At Cambridge, Hawking becomes a member of the Institute of Astronomy.</li>
          <li><strong>1969</strong>, As Hawking's health worsens, he begins to use crutches before eventually being forced to use a wheelchair.</li>
          <li><strong>1970</strong>, Hawking discovers The Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics. Using quantum theory and general relativity, Hawking reveals that black holes can emit radiation.</li>
          <li><strong>1973</strong>, The highly technical The Large Structure of Space-Time is published by Hawking, and marks his first published book.</li>
          <li><strong>1975</strong>, Pope Paul VI awards Hawking the Pius XI Gold Medal for Science.</li>
          <li><strong>1978</strong>, The University of Oxford awards Hawking an honorary doctorate.</li>
          <li><strong>1979</strong>, Upon returning to Cambridge, Hawking is awarded one of the teaching’s most renowned posts, as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, which has only been held by 14 people since 1663 – including Sir Isaac Newton.</li>
          <li><strong>1985</strong>, While in Geneva, Hawking catches pneumonia. Following a tracheotomy, Hawking loses his voice. His speech had become increasingly slurred before the surgical procedure. A computer programmer created a speech synthesizing program for Hawking to communicate with.</li>
          <li><strong>1988</strong>, Hawking's most famous book, A Brief History of Time, is published. He began working on the book in 1982. It sells 10 million copies and is translated into 40 languages, skyrocketing to the top of the bestseller lists in the US and UK. </li>

          <li><strong>2001</strong>, Hawking publishes another book, The Universe in a Nutshell, which wins the Aventis Prizes for Science Books.</li>
          <li><strong>2004</strong>, Announcing that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, Hawking presents his recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.</li>
          <li><strong>2010</strong>, Hawking publishes The Grand Design, arguing against the idea that God created the universe.</li>
          <li><strong>2014</strong>, A film about the life of Hawking and Jane Wilde is released, staring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking.</li>
